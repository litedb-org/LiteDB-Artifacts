# Shared query IR benchmarks

Measured on 2026-09-16 using an AMD Ryzen 9 3900X, Ubuntu 24.04 x64,
.NET 8.0.30, SDK 10.0.400, Release builds with `TestingEnabled=false`.
Both processes were pinned to CPU 2 with tiered compilation disabled. No build
or test process ran concurrently with the recorded benchmark pairs.

Baseline: `828d760fb686501a43dcf8163d9519cf1bf1521d`. Implementation: the shared
query IR and binding changes in this PR. The later upstream base commit
`8654cbe8` changes only CI and a connection-string test, so the measured baseline
library is also the library at that base.

Three separate process pairs ran in alternating order: before/after,
after/before, before/after. Each process collected 15 samples per workload after
warmup. The tables report the median of all 45 samples. All shared workloads'
consumed-result checksums matched across revisions and processes.

The in-memory database contains 10,000 deterministic documents and `_id`, `Age`,
and `City` indexes. Query benchmarks include expression construction, planning,
execution, and result consumption/materialization. They do not include database
creation or index building. Raw samples, allocation counts, Gen0 measurements,
and checksums are in [benchmarks/query-ir](benchmarks/query-ir).

Ordinary end-to-end indexed queries took **6–26% less time** in these runs.
The changing-parameter query improved from 85.09 to 62.99 µs; the point lookup
improved from 50.76 to 42.98 µs. Reusing a bound template reduced those costs
further to 35.19 and 30.55 µs respectively. Binding still allocates independent
parameter/predicate objects; it avoids repeated translation and compilation.

Translation took 16–61% less time and allocated 41–60% fewer bytes across the
five measured shapes. The projection case shows the smallest translation gain.
The full scan and SQL control were effectively unchanged; differences of a few
percent on this shared host are not evidence of a reliable speedup.

For context on variation, the three per-process point-lookup medians were
49.91/50.76/50.79 µs before and 44.06/42.46/42.22 µs after. Indexed projection
medians were 102.43/105.26/102.92 µs before and 96.47/95.81/100.76 µs after.
These are local measurements, not a guarantee for disk-bound workloads or other
hardware. Full scans are dominated by document execution/materialization, while
small indexed queries expose more frontend cost.

## Reproduction

See [the harness instructions](https://github.com/litedb-org/LiteDB/blob/4599cb3a9c4f72f2a70a9142de9cc43959b2a4b4/tools/QueryIrBenchmarks/README.md). The runner
can compile against either revision's production assembly without copying the
old translator into production or introducing a compatibility switch. Reproduce
the table from the checked-in data with:

```sh
python3 tools/QueryIrBenchmarks/compare.py \
  --before docs/benchmarks/query-ir/before-*.json \
  --after docs/benchmarks/query-ir/after-*.json
```
